# my-social-network

## Description 

This application is an API for a fictitious social network application. It uses Express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM and was tested using Insomnia. In this project, I learned how to make a model and a schema using Moongoose ODM.  My motivation behind this project was to integrate NoSQL with modern functionality. 


## Usage
I was able to achieve all the CRUD Operation so this can be used to access all the CRUD using MongoDB. Friends can be added. reactions and htoughts for every user can be added as well.
